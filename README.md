## Description

Are you tired of scouring the web to find out when the next episode of your favorite show will air? Relax! 
TV Tracker is here! TV Tracker is the perfect way to keep track of all your favorite shows.  With TV Tracker you can
search or browse to find shows, add them to a profile, and then check out the calendar page for an simple 
view of when new episodes will be on TV!

This app is built with help of the [tvdb_party gem](https://github.com/maddox/tvdb_party) and the
[tvdb](http://thetvdb.com/). Please check out and contribute to both of these projects if you can,
this app wouldn't have been possible without their hard work.
