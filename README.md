# TV Tracker

By Tyler Pottle and Kevin Townsend

## Description

This app allows users to add their favorite TV shows and lets them keep
track of when new episode will air.
Users will be able to create a profile, add shows to a watchlist, and keep track
of which shows air on what day on a calendar page.  Shows can be added to
a user's watchlist or removed.

The benefit of this app is that it is a one stop resource to find out what day
a show is going to air, if a new episode is going to be on this week, or if the
show is on hiatus.  All at the ease of your fingertips.
